# Comprehensive data testing is done in the jsr223 package, instead of here, for
# a two reasons. First, the tests are much easier to write with the help of
# JavaScript. Second, the jdx functionality was originally a part of jsr223 when
# the tests were originally developed.
# 
# See jsr223 test scripts for data exchange unit tests.
